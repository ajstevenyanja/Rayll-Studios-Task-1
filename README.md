# Rayll-Studios-Task-1
Submission of Task 1 for Unity Developer Internship.

For your reference, here are some technical notes:
- Unity Version: 2022.3.10f1
- The HideTrigger toggles the voice activity bar.
- DoorMaterialFader (attached to porta-potty-door) can perform both fade in and fade out. By default, I've set an instant switch to opaque on door opening, but fade-out can be activated by enabling the fadeOnExit bool from the inspector.

Here is a Video demonstrating the mechanics of Task 1:
